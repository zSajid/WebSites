			Networking Simulator is a video game being created for the Spring 2016 CS426 Senior Project course by team 10 at the University of Nevada, Reno. Networking Simulator's purpose is to teach students about networking through a graphical approach as opposed to the text-based approach a text-book would provide otherwise. The picture underneath is a screenshot of the in-game gameplay of Networking Simulator.
