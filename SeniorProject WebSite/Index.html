              NetCity 3D is a video game developed for the Spring 2016 CS426 Senior Project
        			course by team 10 at the University of Nevada, Reno. NetCity 3D's purpose is to educate
        			students about networking through a graphical approach as opposed to the text-based approach schools would utilize
              . The intended audience are students from middle and high school,
        			who do not know network security basicalities. In this day and age, networks exist everywhere,
        			the biggest network being the internet, brings the lives of millions together, offering the world
        			a variety of things. However, on a day to day
        			basis, the internet is constantly threatened by ill-intentions, most of these intentions are successful
        			due to the users as opposed to the skills of the attacker.
              </p>

              <p class="Description" style="text-indent:50px;"> The reasoning behind this is the lack of
        			understanding that the user has, it make sense though, networking from a top-down perspective is not
        			easy to comprehend, it contains far too many structures too many concepts that build upon each other
        			too quickly. The thought of a packet coming and going to a computer is mind boggling, let alone anything
        			from hackers stealing their packets or even understanding what a firewall is; this is due to the fact
        			they cannot imagine it. As such a videogame is the type of software that would cater to this problem,
        			in which a learning experience can be gained through graphical and entertaining fidelity as opposed to
        			a stressful memorizing one. NetCity 3D's focus is to make students aware of the threats and want them to learn more
              about networking after playing<br><br>
