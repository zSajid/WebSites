      Networking Simulator is a video game being created for the Spring 2016 CS426 Senior Project
			course by team 10 at the University of Nevada, Reno. Networking Simulator's purpose is to teach
			students about networking through a graphical approach as opposed to the text-based approach a
			text-book would provide otherwise. The intended audience are students from middle and high school,
			who still do not know much about network security. In this day and age, networks exist everywhere,
			the biggest network being the internet, brings the lives of millions together, offering the world
			a variety of things. from sharing ideas, to learning new concepts, or creating a new occupation the
			world has never seen and really just bringing the world closer together. However, on a day to day
			basis, the internet is constantly threatened by ill-intentions, most of these intentions are successful
			due to the users as opposed to the skills of the attacker. The reasoning behind this is the lack of
			understanding that the user has, it make sense though, networking from a top-down perspective is not
			easy to comprehend, it contains far too many structures too many concepts that build upon each other
			too quickly. The thought of a packet coming and going to a computer is mind boggling, let alone anything
			from hackers stealing their packets or even understanding what a firewall is; this is due to the fact
			they cannot imagine it. As such a videogame is the type of software that would cater to this problem,
			in which a learning experience can be gained through graphical and entertaining fidelity as opposed to
			a stressful memorizing one. <br><br>
