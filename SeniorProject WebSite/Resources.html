										NetCity 3D is a video game being created for the Spring 2016 CS426
										 Senior Project course at the University of Nevada, Reno. Networking Simulator is
										 a program intended to teach students about networking. The following were used
										 as refrences for the project.

							      How to Design an Educational Game.
										This article was published by Knewton on their website. It breaks down the
										design of an educational game into parts to  have a successful fun game while
										at the same time making it educational. This is beneficial to our group as we
										are also trying to make an educational game while also teaching the user the
										basics of networks.

							      Unity vs. Unreal.
							      For our project we chose Unity as our desired game engine. Essentially the
										article that we listed demonstrates the differences between Unity and Unreal
										in terms of programming, the cost of each and how much developers earn and of
										course the last portion which compares the assets that are offered within different
										engines.

										Maya vs. Blender.
										For our project we have to choose a program to do our models and animations
										because we would like to use our own rather than just buy the assets on line.
										This article demonstrates the advantages between two big modeling programs,
										Blender and Maya. We made a decision to use Blender as our modeling engine. <br>

										Network Security. <br>
							      For our project we needed to teach the users the fundamentals of networking
										security without going into the jargon. So this journal describes the basics
										of network security and then goes deeper into describing the different sort of
										attacks. For example, we are incorporating passive attacks by sending a package
										which will appear as a car in which the users data will be stolen unless they
										detect it otherwise in which it will be explained what type of security attack
										it is. <br>

										Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter by Tom Bissell<br>
