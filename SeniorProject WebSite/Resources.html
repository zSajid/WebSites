			Networking Simulator is a video game being created for the Spring 2016 CS426
			 Senior Project course at the University of Nevada, Reno. Networking Simulator is
			 a program intended to teach students about networking. The following were used
			 as refrences for the project.

      How to Design an Educational Game. <br>
			This article was published by Knewton on their website. It breaks down the
			design of an educational game into parts to  have a successful fun game while
			at the same time making it educational. This is beneficial to our group as we
			are also trying to make an educational game while also teaching the user the
			basics of networks.<br>

      Unity vs. Unreal. <br>
      For our project we chose Unity as our desired game engine. Essentially the
			article that we listed demonstrates the differences between Unity and Unreal
			in terms of programming, the cost of each and how much developers earn and of
			course the last portion which compares the assets that are offered within different
			engines.<br>

			<br>
			Maya vs. Blender. <br>
			For our project we have to choose a program to do our models and animations
			because we would like to use our own rather than just buy the assets on line.
			This article demonstrates the advantages between two big modeling programs,
			Blender and Maya. We made a decision to use Blender as our modeling engine. <br>

			Network Security. <br>
      For our project we needed to teach the users the fundamentals of networking
			security without going into the jargon. So this journal describes the basics
			of network security and then goes deeper into describing the different sort of
			attacks. For example, we are incorporating passive attacks by sending a package
			which will appear as a car in which the users data will be stolen unless they
			detect it otherwise in which it will be explained what type of security attack
			it is. <br>

			Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter by Tom Bissell<br>
      This is a book about the videogames, on how they have developed over the last
			decade and why they are so important.
